[00:08.56] Seated in rows
[00:11.03] Knees and eyes closed, I felt pretty
[00:17.16] In the shoes and the dress
[00:19.80] Confused by the rest, could he hear me?
[00:26.91] Lydia wears a cross
[00:28.57] Says she's never gonna take it off
[00:30.75] We sit back to back
[00:35.92] Listening to Jesus Christ
[00:39.12] Superstar soundtrack
[00:44.33] I'd be a believer
[00:48.17] If it was all just song and dance
[00:53.38] I'd be a believer
[00:57.21] If I thought we had a chance
[01:03.17] Eyes to the board
[01:05.36] Thoughts to our Lord
[01:07.03] We were praying for
[01:12.08] Princess Diana
[01:16.22] Miss Brown was keeping score
[01:21.08] Vivien's holding on
[01:22.79] But singing every single word wrong
[01:25.10] On the parade float
[01:29.65] Just a child in a leotard beneath
[01:33.65] A technicolor dream coat
[01:38.59] I'd be a believer
[01:42.35] If it was all just song and dance
[01:47.64] I'd be a believer
[01:51.35] If I thought we had a chance
[02:15.02] The line up, the quiet
[02:19.41] The bleeding heart divided
[02:23.84] Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me
[02:27.12] Go on, now you try it, ooh
[02:33.24] We sung, "Welcome to the family"
[02:37.53] Arms raised, at every assembly
[02:41.93] Little sirens singing their songs
[02:46.24] Where have the babies gone?
[02:50.17] I'd be a believer
[02:53.76] If it was all just song and dance
[02:59.01] I'd be a believer
[03:02.65] If I thought we had a chance
