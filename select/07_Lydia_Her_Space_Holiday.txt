I'm losing my mind
In a record amount of time
Is it all in my head
These ghosts in the hallways and mirrors
And under my bed

And each time I find
There's always a graveyard nearby
I'm taking her home
That girl from Glasgow's father
Just left her alone

And I was so moved
Inside that crooked room
I reached out my hand
And shyly asked her to dance
She cried as we swayed
And in my head that song continues to play
The saddest melody
Just won't go away

And in my mind, she's fully real
A little voice that helps me feel
And if they thought I was crazy then
Wait until they meet my friend
